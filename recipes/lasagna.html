            <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meat is browned and the onion is softened. Drain any excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine. Simmer the sauce for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
            <li>In a greased baking dish, spread a layer of the meat sauce. Top with a layer of cooked lasagna noodles. Spread a layer of mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta cheese over the noodles. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving. Slice and serve with a sprinkle of fresh basil on top.</li>
